## Project Overview

This application manages which engineers are assigned to which projects, tracks their capacity usage, and shows when they'll be available next. It supports two user roles:

- **Manager**  
  - Create/Edit/Delete Projects  
  - Assign/Update/Delete Engineer Assignments  
  - See a dashboard of all engineers, their capacities, and availability  
  - View analytics (team utilization chart) and search/filter engineers by skill  

- **Engineer**  
  - Log in and view only their own assignments and capacity  
  - View "My Profile" (edit skills, seniority, etc.)  

All data is persisted in MongoDB via Mongoose. Authentication is JWT-based, with "engineer" vs. "manager" roles enforcing access control.

---

## Core Features

1. **Authentication & User Roles**  
   - JWT login (email + password) with two roles: `manager` and `engineer`.  
   - Engineers see only their own data; managers see everything.

2. **Engineer Management**  
   - CRUD for engineer profiles (name, skills, seniority, capacity, department).  

3. **Project Management**  
   - CRUD for projects (name, description, dates, required skills, status, team size).  

4. **Assignment System**  
   - Assign engineers to projects with an allocation percentage (0â€“100).  
   - Capacity validation on create/update: cannot exceed `maxCapacity`.  
   - CRUD for assignments.

5. **Dashboard Views**  
   - **Manager Dashboard**:  
     - Team overview with capacity bars  
     - Search/filter engineers by skill  
     - Analytics chart (team-wide utilization)

   - **Engineer Dashboard**:  
     - My current and upcoming assignments  
     - My capacity bar  

6. **Search & Analytics**  
   - Filter engineers by skill substring.  
   - Filter projects by status (`planning`, `active`, `completed`).

7. **AI-Powered Development Approach**  
   - AI tools were used throughout: Cursor IDE, Claude, GitHub Copilot, etc.  
   - All AI-generated code was manually validated.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v18+ & npm v8+  
- **MongoDB** (local or hosted)  
- **Git** 

### Clone & Install

```bash
# 1. Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/SiddaramMetri/erms-app.git .

# 2. Install server (backend) dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# 3. Install client (frontend) dependencies
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory:

```bash
# backend/.env
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/erms
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key
JWT_EXPIRE=7d
```

### Seeding the Database

```bash
cd backend
npm run seed
```

This creates sample data:
- 4 engineers with different skills/capacities
- 3 projects with various requirements  
- 6 assignments showing different scenarios
- 1 manager account and 4 engineer accounts

### Run Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
# Server runs on http://localhost:5000
```

### Run Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
# Frontend runs on http://localhost:5173
```

## AI Tools & Workflow

### Which AI Tools Were Used

#### Primary Development Environment
- **Cursor IDE**: Used as the primary development environment with AI-powered code completion and generation
- **Claude (Anthropic)**: Leveraged for architecture decisions, code review, and complex problem-solving  
- **GitHub Copilot**: Integrated for real-time code suggestions and boilerplate generation

#### Specific AI Applications

1. **Code Generation & Boilerplate**
   - Generated initial React components with TypeScript interfaces
   - Created Express.js route handlers and middleware
   - Auto-generated database schemas and validation rules
   - Built comprehensive form handling with React Hook Form

2. **Architecture & Design Decisions**
   - Consulted AI for optimal database schema design
   - Received guidance on React state management patterns
   - Got recommendations for security middleware implementation
   - Optimized API endpoint structure and naming conventions

3. **Problem-Solving & Debugging**
   - Used AI to troubleshoot authentication flow issues
   - Resolved complex MongoDB aggregation queries
   - Fixed TypeScript type definition conflicts
   - Optimized performance bottlenecks in capacity calculations

### How AI Accelerated Development
**AI Solution**: Generated reusable components with proper interfaces:
```typescript
interface EngineerCardProps {
  engineer: Engineer;
  assignments: Assignment[];
  onAssign: (engineerId: string) => void;
}

const EngineerCard: React.FC<EngineerCardProps> = ({ engineer, assignments, onAssign }) => {
  const currentLoad = assignments.reduce((sum, a) => sum + a.allocationPercentage, 0);
  const availableCapacity = engineer.maxCapacity - currentLoad;
  
  return (
    <Card className="p-4">
      <div className="flex justify-between items-start mb-2">
        <h3 className="font-semibold">{engineer.name}</h3>
        <Badge variant={availableCapacity > 0 ? 'default' : 'destructive'}>
          {availableCapacity}% available
        </Badge>
      </div>
      <Progress value={(currentLoad / engineer.maxCapacity) * 100} className="mb-2" />
      <div className="flex flex-wrap gap-1">
        {engineer.skills.map((skill, idx) => (
          <Badge key={idx} variant="outline" className="text-xs">
            {skill.skill}
          </Badge>
        ))}
      </div>
    </Card>
  );
};
```

### Challenges with AI-Generated Code

#### 1. TypeScript Interface Conflicts
**Challenge**: AI generated conflicting type definitions between frontend and backend.

**Resolution**: Created a shared types file and manually aligned interfaces.

#### 2. Security Oversight
**Challenge**: AI-generated CORS configuration was too permissive for production.

**Resolution**: Manually configured environment-specific CORS settings.

### Validating AI Suggestions

#### 1. Code Review Process
- **Manual Review**: Every AI-generated code block was manually reviewed line by line
- **Testing**: Each function was tested independently before integration
- **Security Check**: Verified security implications of generated middleware and authentication logic

#### 2. Understanding Before Implementation
- **Documentation**: Added comprehensive comments to explain AI-generated complex logic
- **Refactoring**: Modified AI suggestions to fit project architecture and coding standards
- **Optimization**: Improved performance of AI-generated database queries

#### 3. Iterative Refinement
- **Multiple Iterations**: Used AI suggestions as starting points, then refined through multiple iterations
- **Context Awareness**: Ensured AI-generated code understood the broader application context
- **Edge Case Handling**: Manually added error handling for edge cases AI might have missed

#### 4. Best Practices Learned
- **Never Copy-Paste Blindly**: Always understand the purpose and implications of AI-generated code
- **Security First**: Manually review all security-related code, especially authentication and authorization
- **Test Thoroughly**: AI-generated code often covers happy paths but may miss edge cases
- **Maintain Consistency**: Ensure AI-generated code follows project conventions and patterns
